# Fundamentals-of-Python-Data-Structures
An array is like a list, but the client can use only [], len, iter(for) and str. The basic level of list is array. 

We use the list to study the Array. In the array, coder can not add in or delete the elementes. However, the we can use some algorithm to achieve those function. 

In python, theose algorithm are be packaged and there are all in the function. 

In this section, we will also introduct the linked structure. The only different between the array and linked is array is consequent in the memory while linked is not. Linked use pointer to indicate next data. 

Linked structure can add or delete element in the link and this active does not need to use axera memory.
